🌍 Carbon Footprint Analysis - Power BI Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This Power BI project provides a detailed and interactive analysis of Carbon Footprint trends across different years, countries, and sectors. The dashboard is designed to help users understand how carbon emissions are evolving globally and identify key contributors over time.
🧩 Key Visualizations

The dashboard contains the following main chart components:

    📅 Number of Years Chart
    Displays data distribution over the years to track carbon footprint trends and variations over time.

    🌐 Number of Countries Chart
    Represents the number of countries involved in the dataset, allowing comparison of carbon footprint among different nations.

    🏭 Number of Sectors Chart
    Highlights sector-wise contributions to carbon emissions, enabling identification of high-emission industries.

    📈 Year-wise Carbon Footprint Chart
    A detailed time-series visualization of carbon emissions per year, showcasing the increase or decrease of emissions globally or per selected country/sector.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this dashboard is to:

    Provide insights into how carbon emissions have changed over time.

    Identify the top emitting sectors and countries.

    Support data-driven decision making in climate change mitigation strategies.
